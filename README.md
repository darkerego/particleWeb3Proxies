# particleProxies

### About 
<p>
I love [particle](https://particle.network/), they are amazing. It is not very difficult to 
modify most of my code to use particle as my web3 RPC, but sometimes it can be. So 
I decided to just write a script that creates a proxy listening 
on my local host for every chain that particle supports. This way 
I only need to update my RPC endpoint for my HTTPProvider and everything 
just kind of ... works.

### Setup
<p>
Just grab an API keypair from [particle.network](https://particle.network/) and copy 
env.example to .env , update your PROJECT_ID and PROJECT_SERVER_KEY, and you are done!
